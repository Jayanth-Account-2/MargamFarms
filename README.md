*MongoDB:* A flexible NoSQL database for storing data in JSON-like documents. It excels in performance, availability, and scalability, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data and complex queries.

Express.js: A minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies building web APIs and handling HTTP requests, providing robust features and middleware for web and mobile applications.

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially Single Page Applications (SPAs). Its component-based architecture enables code reusability and maintainability.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime based on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript execution. It focuses on performance, making it perfect for scalable and efficient back-end development.
